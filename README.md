# SmallLibrary

This is a small project resulting from a modified Uni project.

It is a database to store Books with their Author, Genre and a personal Rating (school grading system, 1 is best).

It is necessary to download a apache derby jar and add it to the classpath in the respective JDK in which the program is compiled.
